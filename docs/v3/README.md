- Remove complex flags, use smart defaults

### New Features
- Detect and display unresolved GitHub review comments
- Analyze ALL review comments (including nitpicks)
- AI-based impact assessment (TODO/PENDING auto-assignment)
- Modern, clean UI inspired by GitHub CLI
- Context-aware guidance after every command
- Done command automation (verify → commit → resolve → next task)

### Breaking Changes
- v2.5.0: Deprecation warnings
- v3.0.0: Remove deprecated commands, maintain aliases for backward compatibility
