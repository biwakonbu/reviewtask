# Issue #204 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive comment analysis with AI-based impact assessment for automatic TODO/PENDING status assignment.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: AI Prompt Enhancement for Impact Assessment
- Update analysis prompt to analyze all comments without filtering
- Evaluate implementation effort/impact
- Assign TODO or PENDING based on impact assessment
- Include rationale in task metadata

### Phase 2: Task Generation Flow with Auto-Status Assignment
- Implement impact assessment logic
- Auto-assign status based on impact (Small/Medium: TODO, Large: PENDING)
- Store impact assessment rationale

### Phase 3: PENDING Task User Guidance
- Implement user guidance for PENDING tasks
- Display clear next steps when PENDING tasks exist

### Phase 4: Unit Tests with Mocks
- Create comprehensive unit tests for impact assessment
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Phase 5: Integration Tests
- Create end-to-end integration tests
- Verify impact assessment accuracy

### Phase 6: Documentation Update
- Update user documentation
- Update developer documentation

## Impact Assessment Criteria (AI Guidance)

### TODO (Small/Medium Impact)
- Changes to existing code < 50 lines
- No architecture changes
- No new dependencies
- Quick fixes and improvements

### PENDING (Large Impact)
- Changes to existing code > 50 lines
- Architecture or design changes
- New dependencies or major refactoring
- Requires significant discussion or planning

## Success Criteria
- All review comments generate tasks (no filtering)
- AI correctly assesses impact
- Tasks automatically assigned TODO or PENDING
- PENDING tasks have clear guidance
- Impact assessment rationale stored
- Tests covering impact assessment logic
- Documentation updated
