# Issue #204 Implementation Status

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive comment analysis with AI-based impact assessment for automatic TODO/PENDING status assignment.

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: AI Prompt Enhancement for Impact Assessment (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated system prompt to analyze ALL comments without filtering
- ✅ Added comprehensive comment analysis section (nitpicks, questions, suggestions)
- ✅ Implemented AI-powered impact assessment criteria
- ✅ Defined clear TODO vs PENDING criteria (50-line threshold, architecture changes)
- ✅ Enhanced prompt with impact assessment examples

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ai/analyzer.go` - Enhanced system prompt at line 672-745

### ✅ Phase 2: Task Generation Flow with Auto-Status Assignment (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Modified `convertToStorageTasks` to respect AI-assigned `initial_status`
- ✅ Updated `SimpleTaskRequest` to `TaskRequest` conversion logic
- ✅ Implemented fallback to pattern-based detection when AI doesn't provide status
- ✅ Fixed MockClaudeClient to support empty status for testing
- ✅ Updated all tests to validate new status flow
- ✅ Updated golden test files with new prompt structure

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ai/analyzer.go` - Updated `convertToStorageTasks` (line 1186-1227)
- `internal/ai/analyzer.go` - Updated task conversion logic (line 1504-1527)
- `internal/ai/analyzer_test.go` - Fixed status preservation test
- `internal/ai/mock_claude_client.go` - Updated default responses
- `internal/ai/testdata/prompts/` - Updated golden test files

### ✅ Phase 3: PENDING Task User Guidance (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Enhanced `pendingTasksGuidance()` function with clearer messaging
- ✅ Aligned guidance format with Issue #204 specification
- ✅ Added clear "start or cancel" decision prompts
- ✅ Simplified command suggestions

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/guidance/guidance.go` - Enhanced `pendingTasksGuidance()` (line 131-159)

### ✅ Phase 4: Unit Tests with Mocks (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated `impact_assessment_test.go` to test new fallback logic
- ✅ Tests cover AI-assigned status preservation
- ✅ Tests cover task consolidation with mixed statuses
- ✅ Tests verify empty `initial_status` triggers pattern-based detection
- ✅ All test scenarios passing (100% success rate)

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ai/impact_assessment_test.go` - Updated to match new implementation

### ✅ Phase 5: Integration Tests (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration test suite
- ✅ End-to-end tests for all comment types (nitpicks, suggestions, questions)
- ✅ Impact assessment accuracy tests for small/medium/large changes
- ✅ Fallback behavior tests for pattern-based detection
- ✅ All integration tests passing

**Files Created:**
- `internal/ai/comprehensive_comment_analysis_integration_test.go` - New integration test file

### ✅ Phase 6: Documentation Update (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated implementation plan with completion status
- ✅ Documented all modified files and line numbers
- ✅ Documented test coverage and results

## Post-Implementation Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Consolidated Task Status Fallback (2025-10-07)

**Issue:** Consolidated tasks were always initialized with hardcoded `"todo"` status, preventing fallback logic from working properly.

**Root Cause:**
In `consolidateTasksIfNeeded()` function, the code initialized `consolidatedStatus := "todo"` which prevented the pattern-based detection in `convertToStorageTasks()` from working when:
- Multiple tasks without `initial_status` were merged
- Low-priority patterns (nit:, minor:) needed detection
- Custom `DefaultStatus` configuration needed to be respected

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed initialization from `consolidatedStatus := "todo"` to `consolidatedStatus := ""`
- Only set status when source tasks have explicit `initial_status`
- Prioritize "pending" status when found in any source task
- Use first non-empty status found if no "pending" status exists
- Allow empty status to pass through to `convertToStorageTasks()` for fallback logic

**Impact:**
- ✅ Low-priority patterns (nit:, minor:) now correctly trigger pending status via fallback
- ✅ Custom `DefaultStatus` configuration is now properly respected
- ✅ Consolidated tasks correctly inherit explicit status from source tasks
- ✅ Empty status values properly trigger pattern-based detection

**Commit:** `be7ccba` - "fix: Restore fallback status for consolidated tasks"

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/ai/analyzer.go` (line 1546-1565)

**Tests:** All existing tests pass (100% success rate)

## Impact Assessment Criteria (AI Guidance)

### TODO (Small/Medium Impact)
- Changes to existing code < 50 lines
- No architecture changes
- No new dependencies
- Quick fixes and improvements

### PENDING (Large Impact)
- Changes to existing code > 50 lines
- Architecture or design changes
- New dependencies or major refactoring
- Requires significant discussion or planning

## Success Criteria
- All review comments generate tasks (no filtering)
- AI correctly assesses impact
- Tasks automatically assigned TODO or PENDING
- PENDING tasks have clear guidance
- Impact assessment rationale stored
- Tests covering impact assessment logic
- Documentation updated
