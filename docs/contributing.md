## Release Process

### Version Bumping with PR Labels

When creating a PR, add one of these labels to indicate the type of version bump:

- **`release:major`** - Breaking changes (increment X.0.0)
  - Use when: Removing features, changing APIs, incompatible changes
  - Example: Removing CLI commands, changing config format

- **`release:minor`** - New features (increment x.Y.0)
  - Use when: Adding new functionality, backwards-compatible changes
  - Example: New commands, new options, performance improvements

- **`release:patch`** - Bug fixes (increment x.y.Z)
  - Use when: Fixing bugs, documentation updates, small improvements
  - Example: Fixing errors, typos, small optimizations

### Label Guidelines

1. **One Label Per PR**: Only add one release label per PR
2. **Add Early**: Add the label when creating the PR or during review
3. **Automatic Release**: When merged, the PR will trigger an automatic release
4. **Label Removal**: The label is automatically removed after release

### Examples

```markdown
# PR Title: Fix error handling in PR detection
Labels: release:patch, bug

# PR Title: Add support for multiple repositories
Labels: release:minor, enhancement

# PR Title: Redesign configuration system
Labels: release:major, breaking-change
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR with clear description**
   - Explain what changes you made
   - Reference any related issues
   - Add appropriate labels

2. **Add Release Label**
   - Choose one: `release:major`, `release:minor`, or `release:patch`
   - Based on the type of changes

3. **Wait for Review**
   - Address reviewer feedback
   - Keep PR up to date with main branch

4. **Automatic Release**
   - Once merged, release is created automatically
   - Version bump based on your label
   - Release notes generated from commits

## Getting Help

- Check the [documentation](docs/)
- Look at existing issues and PRs
