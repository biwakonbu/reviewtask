- **`reviewtask config show`** - Display current verification configuration
- **`reviewtask config set-verifier <task-type> <command>`** - Configure custom verification commands

## Task Priority System:

Tasks are automatically assigned priority levels that determine processing order:
- **`critical`** - Security issues, critical bugs, breaking changes
- **`high`** - Important functionality issues, major improvements
- **`medium`** - Moderate improvements, refactoring suggestions
- **`low`** - Minor improvements, style suggestions

## Initial Setup (Execute ALWAYS at Start):

**CRITICAL: Always fetch latest reviews first to detect new comments and ensure local data is up-to-date.**

Run the integrated workflow to sync with GitHub:

- `reviewtask` - Fetches PR reviews from GitHub and analyzes them with AI to generate actionable tasks
- `reviewtask [PR_NUMBER]` - Same workflow for a specific PR number

**This step is MANDATORY even if you think you have the latest data.** New review comments may have been added since your last check, and the tool will automatically:
- Detect new unresolved comment threads
- Generate new tasks from new review feedback
- Update task counts and progress tracking
- Identify any discrepancies between local and remote state

After fetching the latest reviews, follow this exact workflow:

## Workflow Steps:

1. **Check Status**: Use `reviewtask status` to check current task status and identify any tasks in progress
   - **If all tasks are completed (no todo, doing, or pending tasks remaining)**: Check if new comments exist by running `reviewtask` again
   - **If only pending tasks remain**: Review each pending task and decide action (see Step 2d)
   - **Continue only if todo, doing, or pending tasks exist**

2. **Identify Task**:
   a) **Priority order**: Always work on tasks in this order:
      - **doing** tasks first (resume interrupted work)
      - **todo** tasks next (new work, prioritized by: critical → high → medium → low)
      - **pending** tasks last (blocked work requiring decision)

   b) **For doing tasks**: Continue with the task already in progress

   c) **For todo tasks**:
      - First, evaluate if the task is needed using the **Task Classification Guidelines** below
      - If needed: Use `reviewtask show` to get the next recommended task, then run `reviewtask update <task-id> doing`
      - If duplicate/unnecessary: Use `reviewtask cancel <task-id> --reason "explanation"` to cancel and notify reviewers
      - If uncertain: Update to `pending` with `reviewtask update <task-id> pending`

   d) **For pending-only scenario**:
      - List all pending tasks and their reasons for being blocked
      - For each pending task, decide:
        - `doing`: If you can now resolve the blocking issue
        - `todo`: If the task should be attempted again
        - `cancel`: If the task is no longer relevant or cannot be completed
      - Update task status: `reviewtask update <task-id> <new-status>`

3. **Verify Task Start**: Confirm the status change was successful before proceeding

4. **Execute Task**: Implement the required changes in the current branch based on the task description and original review comment

5. **Complete Task**: When implementation is finished, use the done command for full automation:
   - **Recommended (Full Automation)**: `reviewtask done <task-id>`
     - Automatically runs verification checks
     - Creates structured commit with task details
     - Resolves GitHub review thread (if configured)
     - Suggests next task to work on

   - **Skip Options** (when needed):
     - `reviewtask done <task-id> --skip-verification` - Skip verification checks
     - `reviewtask done <task-id> --skip-commit` - Skip automatic commit
     - `reviewtask done <task-id> --skip-resolve` - Skip thread resolution
     - `reviewtask done <task-id> --skip-suggestion` - Skip next task suggestion

   - **Alternative Commands**:
     - `reviewtask verify <task-id>` - Run verification checks only
     - `reviewtask update <task-id> done` - Direct status update (no automation)

   **Note**: The `done` command automatically creates commits with proper formatting when auto-commit is enabled.

6. **Review Automation Results**: After running `reviewtask done`:
   - Check verification results (if verification enabled)
   - Review the generated commit (if auto-commit enabled)
   - Verify thread resolution status (if auto-resolve enabled)
   - Note the suggested next task (if suggestion enabled)

7. **Continue Workflow**: After committing:
   - Check status again with `reviewtask status`
   - **If all tasks are completed (no todo, doing, or pending tasks remaining)**: Stop here - all work is done!
   - **If only pending tasks remain**: Handle pending tasks as described in Step 2d
   - **If todo or doing tasks remain**: Repeat this entire workflow from step 1

## Task Classification Guidelines:

### When to CANCEL Tasks:

Use `reviewtask cancel <task-id> --reason "explanation"` for tasks that are:
- **Clear duplicates**: Already implemented features or duplicate review comments
- **Already completed**: Changes finished in previous commits (reference commit hash in reason)
- **Obsolete suggestions**: No longer applicable to current code
- **Conflicting changes**: Would introduce conflicts with existing implementations

**Important**: Always provide a clear cancellation reason to help reviewers understand why feedback wasn't addressed. The reason will be posted as a comment on the GitHub review thread.

**Examples**:
```bash
reviewtask cancel task-abc123 --reason "This was already addressed in commit 1a2b3c4"
reviewtask cancel task-xyz789 --reason "Duplicate of task-def456 which is already completed"
reviewtask cancel --all-pending --reason "Deferring all remaining tasks to follow-up PR #125"
```

### When to PENDING Tasks:

Use `reviewtask update <task-id> pending` for tasks that are:
- **Ambiguous requirements**: Need clarification from reviewer
- **Low-priority improvements**: Could be done later
- **External dependencies**: Dependent on external decisions or unclear specifications
- **Non-critical enhancements**: Could be implemented but aren't critical now

### When to Process as TODO:

Keep tasks as `todo` when they are:
- **New functional requirements**: Not yet implemented
- **Critical bug fixes**: Security issues or important bugs
- **Clear improvements**: Specific, actionable suggestions for current code
- **Actionable requirements**: Tasks with clear implementation path

## AI Processing and Task Generation:

The reviewtask tool includes intelligent AI processing that:
- **Automatic Task Creation**: Analyzes PR review comments and automatically generates actionable tasks
- **Task Deduplication**: Identifies and removes duplicate or similar tasks to avoid redundant work
- **Priority Assignment**: Automatically assigns priority levels based on comment content and context
- **Task Validation**: Ensures generated tasks are actionable and properly scoped

## Task Completion Verification:

The tool includes verification capabilities to ensure task quality before completion:

**Verification Types:**
- **Build Verification**: Runs build/compile checks (default: `go build ./...`)
- **Test Execution**: Runs test suites (default: `go test ./...`)
- **Code Quality**: Lint and format checks (default: `golangci-lint run`, `gofmt -l .`)
- **Custom Verification**: Project-specific commands based on task type

**Task Type Detection:**
Tasks are automatically categorized for custom verification:
- `test-task`: Tasks containing "test" or "testing"
- `build-task`: Tasks containing "build" or "compile"
- `style-task`: Tasks containing "lint" or "format"
- `bug-fix`: Tasks containing "bug" or "fix"
- `feature-task`: Tasks containing "feature" or "implement"
- `general-task`: All other tasks

**Configuration:**
- `reviewtask config show` - View current verification settings
- `reviewtask config set-verifier <task-type> <command>` - Set custom verification commands
- Done workflow settings stored in `.pr-review/config.json`

**Done Workflow Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "done_workflow": {
    "enable_auto_resolve": "complete",
    "enable_verification": true,
    "enable_auto_commit": true,
    "enable_next_task_suggestion": true,
    "verifiers": {
      "build": "go build ./...",
      "test": "go test ./...",
      "lint": "golangci-lint run",
      "format": "gofmt -l ."
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Tool Features:

This workflow leverages the full capabilities of the current reviewtask implementation:
- **Multi-source Authentication**: Supports GitHub CLI, environment variables, and configuration files
- **Task Management**: Complete lifecycle management with status tracking and validation
- **Done Command Automation**: Full 5-phase automation for task completion
- **Task Cancellation**: Cancel tasks with GitHub comment notification to reviewers
- **Thread Resolution**: Automatic and manual resolution of review threads
- **Task Completion Verification**: Automated verification checks before task completion
- **Auto-commit**: Structured commit creation with task details and references
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Intelligent task generation and classification with batch processing
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive status reporting and workflow optimization
- **Statistics**: Per-comment task breakdown and progress analysis
- **Next Task Recommendation**: Priority-based suggestion of next task to work on

## Important Notes:

### Workflow Best Practices:
- Work only in the current branch
- Always verify status changes before proceeding
- Include proper commit message format with task details and comment references
- Continue until all tasks are completed or no more actionable tasks remain
- The initial review fetch/analyze is executed only once per command invocation

### Task Priority and Processing:
- **Task Priority**: Always work on `doing` tasks first, then `todo` tasks (by priority level), then handle `pending` tasks
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Within todo tasks, process critical → high → medium → low priority items
- **Automatic Task Generation**: The tool intelligently creates tasks from review feedback with appropriate priorities

### Task Cancellation:
- **Use cancel command**: Use `reviewtask cancel <task-id> --reason "..."` instead of `reviewtask update <task-id> cancel`
- **Provide clear reasons**: Cancellation reasons are posted to GitHub to notify reviewers why feedback wasn't addressed
- **Batch cancellation**: Use `--all-pending` flag to cancel multiple tasks with the same reason
- **Error handling**: Cancel command returns non-zero exit code on failure (safe for CI/CD scripts)

### Task Completion:
- **Recommended approach**: Use `reviewtask done <task-id>` for full automation
- **Automation Features**: The done command provides 5-phase automation:
  1. **Verification**: Runs configured verification checks
  2. **Status Update**: Marks task as done
  3. **Auto-commit**: Creates structured commit with task details
  4. **Thread Resolution**: Resolves GitHub review thread
  5. **Next Task**: Suggests next task to work on
- **Skip Options**: Use `--skip-verification`, `--skip-commit`, `--skip-resolve`, `--skip-suggestion` as needed
- **Configuration**: Enable/disable features in `.pr-review/config.json` under `done_workflow` section

### Thread Management:
- **Manual resolution**: Use `reviewtask resolve <task-id>` when auto-resolve is disabled
- **Batch resolution**: Use `reviewtask resolve --all` to resolve all done tasks at once
- **Force resolution**: Use `--force` flag to resolve threads regardless of task status

### Task Management Tips:
- **Efficient classification**: Use `cancel` command for duplicates/unnecessary tasks to notify reviewers
- **Pending tasks**: Must be resolved by changing status to `doing`, `todo`, or using `cancel` command
- **Statistics**: Use `reviewtask stats` to track progress and identify bottlenecks
